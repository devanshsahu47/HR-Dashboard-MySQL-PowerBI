## Data Used
Data - (Download from Kaggle) HR Data with over 22000 rows from 2000 to 2020.
Data Modelling & Analysis - MySQL Workbench
Data Visualization - Microsoft PowerBI

## Limitations
1. Some records had negative ages and these were excluded during querying(967 records). Ages used were 18 years and above.
2. Some termdates were far into the future and had to be excluded in the analysis(1599 records). The only term dates used were those less than or equal to the current date.
